This is known as COVID-IMPACT and it will help to support research projects from the wider community, including for the National Core Studies.\n\nA dashboard of datasets available in each nation’s TRE can be found here: https://bhfdatasciencecentre.org/areas/cvd-covid-uk-covid-impact/\n\nNote:\n- The demographic information/counts are approximate and rounded. Figures should not be used for anything other than a rough indication of size of the grouping.\n- Counts for people between 5-24 years have been approximated into these bins based on the age bins in the COALESCE study. https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/projects/coalesce/\n- All count of people above the age of 85 years are included in the age bin 85-90 years.",
